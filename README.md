# DeepQLearningBreakout


## Using DeepQLearning on the OpenAI's BreakoutDeterministic-v4 environment

On this project, I trained an AI Agent with **DeepQLearning (Double Deep Q-Learning with Dueling Network Architecture)** on the OpenAI's [BreakoutDeterministic-v4](https://gym.openai.com/envs/Breakout-v0/) environment.
<br><br>In Breakout, a layer of bricks lines the top third of the screen and the goal is **to destroy them all**. A ball moves straight around the screen, bouncing off the top and two sides of the screen. When a brick is hit, the ball bounces back and the brick is destroyed. The player loses a turn when the ball touches the bottom of the screen; to prevent this from happening, the player has a **horizontally movable paddle to bounce the ball upward, keeping it in play**.
